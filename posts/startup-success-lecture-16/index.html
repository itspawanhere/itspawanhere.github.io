  <section><p>When you&rsquo;re creating a product, especially for a specific audience, one of the most important things you can do is truly understand your users. Emmett Shear, Founder and CEO of Justin.tv and Twitch, has shared a wealth of insights on how user interviews can shape your product development, especially when it comes to understanding user behavior, needs, and challenges. In his lecture, Shear emphasizes the importance of engaging with users early on to ensure that you&rsquo;re building a solution people actually want to use. Here&rsquo;s what you can take away from his talk on how to run effective user interviews. The lecture is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-user-research-to-avoid-assumptions">Start with User Research to Avoid Assumptions</h2>
<p>Before diving into building a product, it&rsquo;s essential to do thorough user research. Emmett Shear admits that when Twitch was starting out, the team lacked a deep understanding of gamer broadcasters. However, through conducting user interviews, they were able to gather insights that drove product decisions for the next three years. The key takeaway here is that user research informs everything. It&rsquo;s not just about gathering feedback; it&rsquo;s about listening to the user and understanding their world.</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-right-users-not-just-the-right-questions">Identify the Right Users, Not Just the Right Questions</h2>
<p>One of Shear&rsquo;s most important points is understanding that finding the right users to interview is just as crucial as the questions you ask them. If you&rsquo;re interviewing a broadcaster, you&rsquo;re likely to get very different insights than if you&rsquo;re talking to a viewer. Knowing your target audience and their specific needs allows you to frame the right questions and focus on solving the problems they face. Shear also emphasizes that your research should start with defining your target user—this is the first and most important step.</p>
<h2 id="dig-deep-into-current-user-habits-before-jumping-to-solutions">Dig Deep into Current User Habits Before Jumping to Solutions</h2>
<p>When interviewing users, it&rsquo;s tempting to jump straight to discussing potential features. However, Shear advises against this. In the initial stages, you should focus on understanding the user&rsquo;s current habits, not what they think a product should do. This helps uncover the real challenges users face. For example, when talking to students about note-taking apps, start by asking them about their existing note-taking behaviors before exploring app features. This approach avoids falling into the trap of assuming users want an app just like the one they&rsquo;re already using but with a few minor tweaks.</p>
<h2 id="validate-your-ideas-before-building-anything">Validate Your Ideas Before Building Anything</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to rush into building your product once you have a concept, but Shear stresses the importance of validating your ideas first. This can be done by creating prototypes or even low-cost mockups to test with real users. Instead of asking users directly if they like your idea—because they&rsquo;ll likely give you positive feedback—you should gauge their behavior and reactions to the prototypes. Shear notes that when users are willing to pay for a product, even a small amount, it&rsquo;s a strong indicator of genuine interest. After all, people are unlikely to part with their money for something they don&rsquo;t truly care about.</p>
<h2 id="prioritize-user-needs-over-feature-requests">Prioritize User Needs Over Feature Requests</h2>
<p>During user interviews, it&rsquo;s important to avoid focusing too much on specific feature requests. Users may have preferences or ideas about features, but the core takeaway from your interviews should be the problems they face, not their proposed solutions. Understanding their underlying needs will help you create solutions that address those needs effectively. This is particularly critical when dealing with existing users of other products who may be entrenched in their current workflows and not see the broader possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="interview-a-diverse-range-of-users">Interview a Diverse Range of Users</h2>
<p>To gain a more complete picture, Shear recommends interviewing a diverse set of users. Don&rsquo;t just focus on people who already use your product or a competitor&rsquo;s product. Seek out users from different backgrounds, including those who haven&rsquo;t adopted your solution yet. This is crucial for expanding your product&rsquo;s reach and understanding what non-users need to convert them into active users. By targeting non-users, you can identify key features and strategies to boost your product&rsquo;s market growth.</p>
<h2 id="dont-forget-to-continuously-evolve-your-user-research">Don&rsquo;t Forget to Continuously Evolve Your User Research</h2>
<p>User research isn&rsquo;t a one-time event. As your product grows and your audience changes, your user research should evolve too. Shear highlights that the types of users you interview should adapt over time, ensuring that your product remains relevant and aligned with users&rsquo; needs. Regular user interviews help prevent feature misalignment and keep your product on track. By maintaining this continuous dialogue with users, you&rsquo;ll be able to iterate effectively and stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-listening-to-users-not-just-data">The Power of Listening to Users, Not Just Data</h2>
<p>While data analytics can provide valuable insights into how users are interacting with your product, it&rsquo;s no substitute for direct user feedback. Shear emphasizes that user interviews provide the context and understanding that raw data simply can&rsquo;t. Listening to users allows you to uncover problems and solutions that you might not have considered otherwise. It&rsquo;s about discovering the ‘why&rsquo; behind user actions, not just the ‘what.'</p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-most-significant-pain-points">Focus on the Most Significant Pain Points</h2>
<p>In user interviews, it&rsquo;s essential to focus on identifying the biggest pain points, not just the features users ask for. Users may tolerate certain issues in an app and not actively request solutions. However, these unresolved pain points could be why non-users haven&rsquo;t adopted your product in the first place. By focusing on these obstacles, you can design solutions that truly make a difference in attracting a broader audience.</p>
<h2 id="use-interactive-video-based-interviews-for-deeper-insights">Use Interactive, Video-Based Interviews for Deeper Insights</h2>
<p>Finally, Shear advises conducting user interviews over video calls, such as Skype, rather than through email or surveys. Video calls allow for a more interactive conversation, where you can ask follow-up questions and dig deeper into users&rsquo; responses. This type of real-time interaction enables you to adopt a ‘detective mode,&rsquo; helping you uncover more valuable insights.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>In conclusion, Emmett Shear&rsquo;s insights on user interviews emphasize that understanding your users is fundamental to creating a product that truly addresses their needs. Through focused research, avoiding assumptions, and continuously engaging with users, you can ensure that your product is not only useful but also well-loved. Start with the right users, listen to their problems, and stay flexible as your product evolves.</p>
