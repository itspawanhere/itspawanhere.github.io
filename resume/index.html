<p>As a Senior Engineer in Data Platform at Sophos, I have been involved in creating a new Apache Iceberg-based data pipeline for our data lake. Before this, my primary focus involved creating a new batch detection framework using the data available in the data lake to help the threat hunters detect potentially customer-compromising detections before they happen.</p>
<p>I am leading and mentoring a high-performing team of 5+ engineers to work on cross-team collaboration, elevate code standards, and cultivating a culture of continuous improvement and ownership.</p>
<p>I have used my skills in AWS, Java, Spring, Python, Relational, and Non-relational databases to deliver high-quality solutions that increase transparency, accountability, and efficiency for our clients. Additionally, I have been mentoring 5+ junior engineers in software development best practices and enhancing their technical competencies.</p>
<p>Before joining Sophos, I worked at o9 Solutions, Goldman Sachs, Eureka AI, and Samsung Research Institute, where I gained valuable experience in developing proprietary databases from scratch, building web applications, handling data pipelines in a large-scale system, building desktop applications, building user tracing systems based on their constantly changing geography, and building UX using cutting-edge technologies. I have a Master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur and a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the same field from IIT Guwahati.</p>
<p>I am passionate about exploring new horizons, taking on new challenges, and solving intricate problems in the software engineering world.</p>

<em>Senior Software Engineer II</em><br>
<em>October 2023 - Present</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building Apache Iceberg Based Datalake</strong>: Built a new Apache Iceberg pipeline to pull data from XDR, MDR, firewall, and other sources, replacing our Hive-based legacy pipeline. Queries now run about twice as fast, storage needs dropped by roughly 30%, and data is available in the S3 data lake over 50% sooner. The pipeline also added write support for S3 and time-travel queries, allowing us to track changes automatically for auditing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Tools/Technology used:</strong> Spring Boot, Kafka, Iceberg, Glue, Athena, Grafana, Logz, Metabase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batch Detections &amp; ETL</strong>: Created batch processing framework in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), using which threat researchers can register their detection workflows. Features included running your detection in multi-phases, segregating different types of customers based on licenses, and running ETL jobs before the detection. This new detection framework offered by Sophos helped automate threat detections approximately 10 times faster.</p>
<p><strong>Tools/Technology used:</strong> AWS, Airflow, Kafka, Trino, Avro, Redis, Python, Terraform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AWS Cluster Migration</strong>: Managed AWS infrastructure using Terraform to provision, migrate, and tear down clusters as needed. For example, I shifted ECS workloads from Fargate to EC2, set up auto-scaling based on demand, and right-sized instances per service. These changes cut infrastructure costs by several thousand dollars annually, improved resource utilization, and made deployments more consistent and reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Tools/Technology used:</strong> AWS, Terraform, Unix Scripting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mentoring Work</strong>: Led and mentored a high-performing team of 5+ engineers, driving adoption of modern engineering practices, elevating code standards, and cultivating a culture of continuous improvement and ownership.</p>
